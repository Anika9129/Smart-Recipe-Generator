npm install
```

## Running the Project

You will need two separate terminal windows to run the backend and frontend concurrently.

### 1. Run the Backend Server
In your first terminal, from the `backend` directory:
```bash
cd C:\Users\singh\OneDrive\Desktop\daffodil\smart-recipe-generator\backend
npm start
```
The backend server will start on `http://localhost:5000`.

### 2. Run the Frontend Application
In your second terminal, from the `frontend` directory:
```bash
cd C:\Users\singh\OneDrive\Desktop\daffodil\smart-recipe-generator\frontend
npm start
```
The frontend application will open in your browser, usually at `http://localhost:3000`.
